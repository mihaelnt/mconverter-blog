##What is 3GPP file format?
The 3GPP file format is a video container based on the MP4 format, also known as MPEG-4 Part 14. The 3GP extension is named after its creator, 3GPP (The Third Generation Partnership Project). This video format is primarily designed to be supported across all 3G-enabled devices.

The 3GPP is a multimedia file format that stores video and audio content on mobile devices, specifically on 3GPP-compliant platforms. Besides video and audio data, the 3GP files can store other media-type content, including images and texts. The .3gp file extension is often used to store videos captured on our smartphone cameras or other mobile devices.

##What are 3GPP files used for?
As mentioned above, the 3GPP file format can efficiently store audio and video data on 3GP-compatible mobile devices. Since it is based on the H. 263 or H. 264 codecs for video files and AAC or AMR for audio files, 3GP files are great for lossy compression of video content. In other words, you can store more video and audio content within a compact space.

For example, you can even watch 3GP movies on your mobile device having storage space limitations. 3GP files can maintain decent audio and video quality while saving your disk space. Besides, 3GP files are an excellent option for transferring video files across mobile devices.

3GP files support smooth streaming, allowing users to watch movies or videos without downloading the file entirely. You can play back 3GP files on 3GPP-supported devices and operating systems. If a certain device does not support .3gp files, you can convert them into other readable media formats, such as MP4 or AVI.
